# Installation

## Run using docker command

```bash
mkdir -p ./{config,downloads} && docker run -d --rm --user "${UID}:${UID}" --name ytptube \
-p 8081:8081 -v ./config:/config:rw -v ./downloads:/downloads:rw \
ghcr.io/arabcoders/ytptube:latest
```

Then you can access the WebUI at `http://localhost:8081`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using `podman` instead of `docker`, you can use the same command, but you need to change the user to `0:0`
> it will appears to be running as root, but it will run as the user who started the container.

## Using compose file

The following is an example of a `compose.yaml` file that can be used to run YTPTube.

```yaml
services:
  ytptube:
    user: "${UID:-1000}:${UID:-1000}" # change this to your user id and group id, for example: "1000:1000"
    image: ghcr.io/arabcoders/ytptube:latest
    container_name: ytptube
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config:rw
      - ./downloads:/downloads:rw
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to change the `user` line to match your user id and group id
> If you have low RAM, remove the `tmpfs` and mount a disk-based directory to `/tmp` instead. See [FAQ](FAQ.md#getting-no-space-left-on-device-error) for more information.

```bash
mkdir -p ./{config,downloads} && docker compose -f compose.yaml up -d
```

Then you can access the WebUI at `http://localhost:8081`.

> [!NOTE]
> you can use podman-compose instead of docker-compose, as it supports the same syntax. However, you should change the 
> user to `0:0` it will appears to be running as root, but it will run as the user who started the container.

It’s a personal project designed to make downloading videos from the internet more convenient. It’s not intended for 
piracy or any unlawful use.

This project was built primarily for my own needs and preferences. The UI might not be the most polished or visually 
refined, but I’m happy with it as it is. You can, however, create and load your own UI for complete customization. I 
plan to refactor the UI/UX in the future using [Nuxt/ui](https://ui.nuxt.com/).

Contributions are welcome, but I may decline changes that don’t align with my vision for the project. Unsolicited pull 
requests may be ignored. For suggestions or feature requests, please open a discussion or join the Discord server.
